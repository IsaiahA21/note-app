## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Background info
* Followed a online resource on constructing a Note App using mongoDB, and semantic-ui
 * Made tweaks to the projects as so functionalities were outdated.

* Future expansion ideas include:
    * dateStamp and dateModified to schema
    * about page
    * footer- that has a link to my Linkedin
